                    <h1>SCP-094</h1>
                    <p>Also known as a "miniature event horizon", SCP-094 is a black sphere approximately 20cm to 25cm in diameter at the time of its discovery. SCP-094 was found in the Chubut Province of southern Argentina in 192█ and remains there to this day as the anomaly cannot be moved. SCP-094 seems to be growing and as of 2026 currently sits at ██cm in diameter.</p><br>
                    <p>Anything that enters the anomaly subsequently disappears. It is unknown where these objects are going or whether they are being destroyed. Caution is advised when testing on SCP-094 and is only permitted via 05 clearance. Please see the <a href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-094">official SCP-094 entry log</a> for more information.</p>
